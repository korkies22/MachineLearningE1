Esto significa que la red necesita de pocas capas para ajustarse lo mejor posible al modelo de acuerdo con los datos que hay. Sin embargo, se observa también que la tasa de éxito no llega a 90%, lo que significa que esta red no es capaz de clasificar 9 de cada 10 canciones correctamente pero sí 8 de cada 10 canciones en el límite inferior. Se observa que para capas con muchas neuronas, el porcentaje de éxito tiende a números bajos, cercanos a 0.5 y posteriormente a 0, es posible que el overfitting sea tal que no logra clasificar ningun dato del set de validación correctamente. El tener Relu como mejor función puede significa que los datos solo importan cuando tienen valor positivo, y cuando estos tienen valor negativo no son relevantes para el modelo"
